          What we do: We provide a platform (including this Site, mobile
          applications, etc.) where we, our local affiliates and other sellers
          (collectively, “Sellers”) can list offers for Vouchers, deals, goods,
          getaways and other products (collectively, “Items”). As a platform
          provider, we help facilitate transactions for Items on our platform.
          We are never a buyer and usually not the Seller; we provide a venue
          for Sellers and you to negotiate and complete transactions. This means
          that in addition to this Agreement, you will have other contractual
          relationships with different legal entities when you interact with the
          Site.

          We operate an online marketplace where you can purchase primary
          tickets and resale tickets, as well as other items in connection with
          events.

          We operate pages like: &quot;Event&quot; A specified event on a
          specified date for which Tickets are sold by a Promoter via the
          Website &quot;Venue&quot; Person(s) signing up to StripRadar in order
          to use extended features to advertise a specific venue for which
          booking may be made Depending on the particular functionality of our
          Site at any time, you may or may not need to Register to use much of
          its functionality or to access many of our Services. However, you must
          Register in order to make a purchase unless you choose to use the
          guest checkout feature on the Site.

          Reviews and ratings Our website offers the possibility to rate and
          comment on tours or activities. After you have completed a tour booked
          via our website, we may ask you to rate it accordingly. Submitting a
          rating is, of course, voluntary

          For selected Activities, you may be able to choose the &quot;Reserve
          now&quot; feature. This is only possible with a credit card that is
          valid at least until the date of the selected Activity; to confirm
          this, we will charge 0 GBR to your credit card when you complete your
          booking. 72 hours before the start of the Activity we will debit the
          Booking Price. If the credit card charge fails, you have 47 hours to
          make the payment manually. If this fails and the payment is not made,
          we will automatically cancel the Activity you booked.

          Credit card payments For the processing of payments by credit card, we
          use the service provider Adyen N.V. (&quot;Adyen&quot;), which is
          based in the Netherlands. The data provided during your payment will
          be forwarded by Adyen to the respective banks or financial
          institutions for the purpose of processing the payment. In the case of
          payments by credit card, we only receive the information that a
          payment has or has not been made. We therefore have no knowledge of
          your credit card number.
